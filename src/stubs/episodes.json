        "description": "In this episode of Syntax, Scott and Wes talk about Gatsby vs Next. A lot has changed in the last year — what are the differences, and do the recommendations from Syntax 120 still hold true? Sanity - Sponsor  Sanity.io is a real-time headless CMS with a fully customizable Content Studio built in React. Get a Sanity powered site up and running in minutes at sanity.io/create. Get an awesome supercharged free developer plan on sanity.io/syntax.  Sentry - Sponsor If you want to know what’s happening with your errors, track them with Sentry. Sentry is open-source error tracking that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time. Cut your time on error resolution from five hours to five minutes. It works with any language and integrates with dozens of other services. Syntax listeners can get two months for free by visiting Sentry.io and using the coupon code “tastytreat”.  Show Notes  03:34 - Server-rendered   Both do server rendered  Gatsby is gone at build time  Next is done at build and on deploy   05:26 - Static generation   getStaticProps()  getServerSideProps()   08:25 - Re-rendering pages   Gatsby can be re-rendered and re-deployed - any CMS lets you do this on only the pages that changed.  Gatsby-cloud  Next.js has the revalidate flag that will re-render when stale   18:54 - Data management   Gatsby has a built in GraphQL API feature with  Next.js has nothing - it’s not their problem. Use Apollo, or SWR, React Query, or redux, or whatever you want.   23:16 - Client-side data   Neither do anything, next.   26:33 - Dynamic Pages   List of 100 shoes, each one gets a page  List of four types of shoes: basketball, runners, casual, bowling, etc.  List of 10 colors: each color gets its own page.  List of 12 sizes, each size gets its own page.  Now it gets complicated when you do this:   Show me basketball shoes, in red, in size 5  600 pages minimum  What about size 6+7?  Then you get into having to fetch data on the client side - but all your data is in GraphQL?!  The queries are different!    Gatsby will get “Hosted GraphQL”: https://twitter.com/kylemathews/status/1252803849775009794   30:41 - Routing   Neither do nested routing still  Both do folder based wrapper   34:50 - Hosting   Anywhere   35:54 - Images   Compression/resize  Lazy loading  SVG  Blur up  Next 10 released first revision of Next.js image   It’s not as good as Gatbsy-image  Must specify width and height, whereas gatsby has fixed and fluid  Compression  No blur up  Yes lazy loading  both don’t support gifs  Gatbsy requires annoying GraphQL query OR another plugin like MDX to do it   Not for long! https://twitter.com/ascorbic/status/1320770231657238529    Next.js is just   Next does remote images  Neither have quality or format auto like Cloudinary does  Gatsby images have to be compressed at build time  Next.js can do it on the fly   assuming your server has the right tooling installed      The GOLD STANDARD - https://gridsome.org/docs/images/   Lib authors need to give this a look    https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/1323279745275101184   https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-image   46:20 - Server or Serverless   Gatsby - none. You can do it with Netlify, Begin, AWS, Gatsby doesn’t care.  Next.js - can do server with API routes. Can do serverless if you host on Vercel.   49:44 - SEO   Tags   Gatsby - Helmet  Next - Head    Sitemap   Plugin for both     49:55 - Plugin Ecosystem   Gatsby has lots of plugins that you install  Next.js has some too. Seems Gatsby is easier in this regard because plugins can manage and normalize data into the GRaphQL Layer.   53:10 - Auth   Neither do auth The first to do baked-in auth solution could get big gains. See Scott’s Svelte Meteor accounts set up. It good. https://github.com/leveluptuts/svelte-accounts-ui   55:00 - E-commerce  Gatsby - options are mostly limited to Snipcart and Shopify like iframe drop in solutions where the majority of operations take place on another site and service. Next.js - hey released a starter boilerplate that leans on an existing headless cart https://rainierwatch.com/   Links  Syntax 120: Gatsby vs Next Gatsby Next.js Svelte Meteor Vercel GraphQL https://www.swyx.io/react-sfcs-here/ React Query SWR React Router gatsby-image Cloudinary imgIX Begin Netlify https://reactioncommerce.com/ Shopify SnipCart WooCommerce   ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××  Scott: Cobra Drain Zip It Wes: Deli Containers:  Mixed Boys Small Boys Medium Boys Large Boys     Shameless Plugs  Scott: Animating Svelte - Sign up for the year and save 25%!
